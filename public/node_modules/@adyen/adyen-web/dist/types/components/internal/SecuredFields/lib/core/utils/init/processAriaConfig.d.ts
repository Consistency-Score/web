 * Checks if the merchant has defined an ariaConfig object and if so enhances it with a iframeTitle and label property, if they don't already exist.
 * If the ariaConfig object doesn't exist at all we create one with these 2 properties.
 * The iframeTitle and label properties, where they don't previously exist are populated with values read from the translation file.
 * In both cases we then add an error object containing the possible errors for any securedField read from the translation file and stored under error-codes
 *
 * NOTE: whilst we allow the merchant to overwrite the translated strings with their own iframeTitle and label we currently don't support this for the error object
 * since this is a more complex object involving special, specific codes
